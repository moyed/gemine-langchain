# gemine-langchain
This repository demonstrates the integration of LangChain with Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.- Flash) for building dynamic and context-aware large language model (LLM) applications. The project includes a simple example of question-answering with customizable prompts.


# Features
	•	Google GenAI Integration: Leverage the power of Gemini Pro for generating high-quality responses.
	•	LangChain Chains: Modular design for combining LLMs with task-specific prompts.
	•	Customizable Prompts: Use different templates to adjust tone and response style.
	•	Secure API Access: Use userdata in Google Colab to securely fetch API keys.

# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally or in Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
	•	A Google API key with access to Generative AI models.
	•	Python 3.8+ installed locally (or use Google Colab for an easy setup).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-google-genai-integration.git
   cd langchain-google-genai-integration

2.	Securely add your Google API key in Google Colab or replace the userdata.get() method with your API key in the script:
       ```bash
       GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
# Usage
Run the script in a Python environment or Google Colab
